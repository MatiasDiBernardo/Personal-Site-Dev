## Bio
I am completing a double major in Sound Engineering and Computer Engineering at the National University of Tres de Febrero (UNTREF). I am currently in my final year of the Sound Engineering program and concurrently finishing my studies in Computer Engineering. As CTO of the research group Intercambios Transorgánicos, I lead the development of voice-synthesis technologies tailored to the Argentine (Rioplatense) accent, coordinating everything from data collection and acoustic measurement to model development and deployment.

My work sits at the intersection of digital signal processing and deep learning applied to speech: I design and implement pipelines that combine classical DSP techniques with modern neural approaches to improve robustness and naturalness in TTS systems. I enjoy bridging the methodological rigor of acoustics with practical software engineering, and I focus on reproducible, data-driven solutions that are sensitive to regional phonetic and prosodic characteristics. I am especially interested in scalable methods for dataset creation, automated cleaning, and model fine-tuning that reduce annotation effort while preserving linguistic and acoustic diversity.

## Why I started this blog? 
Many of the projects I’ve started in the past have either fizzled out or ended abruptly. A blog, however, is an excellent way to stay organized and get the most out of my work.

Additionally, documenting my projects here allows me to keep track of my progress and serves as a useful reference for future endeavours. For now, the blog will primarily focus on tech and science topics, but I’m open to expanding into other areas in the future.

## Best reference books? 
As a bonus, here are some of the books that have been most helpful to me across different topics:

* Acoustics: Sound Fields, Transducers and Vibration (2nd Edition) by Leo Beranek 
* Fundamental of Music Processing by Meinard Müller 
* Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow 
* Fundations of Signal Processing by Martin Vetterli 

These are some of my favorites, and I highly recommend them!
