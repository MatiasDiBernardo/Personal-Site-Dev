# Who Am I?
Hi, my name is Matías Di Bernardo. I'm a acoustic and computer engineer student from Argentina. I love learning new subjets and have interest in many topics, like algorithms, deep learning, DSP, acoustics, etc. On my free time I love to play music (I played the piano) and reading.

## Studies
I started studing in 2019 for the Sound Engineer degree on UNTREF University, I choose this carrer because it am a musician but I really like math and science and tought that this carrer could be a good fit in between, but I quicky understand that and engineer degree has a lot to offer and I really enjoy the basic courses on math, and specifically the courses on acoustics and digital signal processing. 

This enhance my passion for programming and computers in general and thats way on 2022 I start the Computer Engineer carrer on paralel on the same university. With the new courses I can solidify my programming concepts, like data strcutures and desing patterns, and explore the teortical part of Artificial Inteligence, a subject that I always have a big interest in.

I am currently on my last year for the Sound Engineer Degree and I am on the third year of the Computer Engineer Degree.

Aside from my formal education, I'am always looking for material on youtube or curses on different platforms that explain topics that I am intetested in. For example, two courses that help me a lot in my education outside my fromal education are *DSP for music application* from Coursera and *Learning from Data*, the youtube series from Caltech University. 

## Work
I have a strong interest on deep learning and I attend some courses on the topic. In 2022, I applied for an academic reaserch group in my university called *Intercambios transorgánicos*, where the objetive is to use technology to help people. In this context, the reasearch group is working on a *Text-to-Speech* model that captures the rio-platense accent, making the technology more accesible and usable for people that lost their voice and use this system to communicate.

This proyect fit my interest perfectly because it combines deep learning, speech processing, dsp and acoustics. I quickly started to get involved with more task and responsabilities, and in 2024 I was promoted to CTO *Chief Technical Officer* and I manage all the technical decisions. Currently I lead a team of 4 students and make reasearch on different key aspects of TTS to improve the capabilities of this technology and make it more accesible.

## Why I started this blog?
Many projects that I start end up in nothing or I finish them abrouptly, in that regard the blog format is excelent to organice and make the most out of a proyect. Also, it is important to me to keep track of what I am doing and it can serve as a good reference for future projects or work, because it is easier to access previos information if I have it well documented here.

For now this blog will be only realted to tech and science, but maybe I do not close the door to open to differente topics in the future.

## Best reference books?
As a bouns, I let the books that work the best for me on different topics:
* Acoustics: Sound Fields, Transducers and Vibration (2nd Edition) by Leo Beranek
* Fundamental of Music Processing by Meinard Müller 
* Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow
* Fundations of Signal Processing by Martin Vetterli

This are the ones that I enjoy the most!
